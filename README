A list of functions for master equation quantum optics simulations based on python QuTiP. 

Simulations include: carrier, red, and blue sideband Rabi flops, free evolution, and Ramsey experiments. 

Can initiallize the ion state to pure states, as well as mixed states, e.g. thernmal, or displaced thermal states. All operations on the ion are a result of a numerical solution of the master equation for the Hamiltonian
evolution + the Lindblad master equation operators. 

This module uses the QuTiP library of functions. See QuTip installation instructions for dependencies.
